## Technologies Used

### Angular
Angular is a popular front-end framework for building single-page applications. It provides powerful features such as two-way data binding, dependency injection, and component-based architecture, making it ideal for developing dynamic web applications.

### Angular Material
Angular Material is a UI component library for Angular applications. It provides a set of pre-built UI components following Material Design guidelines, such as buttons, forms, navigation components, and more. Angular Material helps in creating consistent and visually appealing user interfaces with minimal effort.

### Connectivity with Endpoints
The frontend application is connected to backend endpoints using Angular's HttpClient module. It communicates with the backend server to fetch and send data, enabling seamless integration between the frontend and backend layers of the application.

### Error Handling
The application includes error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle errors that may occur during data retrieval or API calls. It displays meaningful error messages to the user and provides feedback on any unexpected issues encountered during usage.

## Development Commands

- **Code Scaffolding**: You can generate new components, directives, pipes, services, classes, guards, interfaces, enums, or modules using Angular CLI. For example:
  - To generate a new component, run `ng generate component component-name`.
  - To generate other artifacts, replace `component-name` with the desired name and type (directive, pipe, service, etc.).

- **Building the Application**: To build the project, execute `ng build`. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

- **Running Unit Tests**: To execute unit tests using Karma, run `ng test`.

- **Running End-to-End Tests**: To execute end-to-end tests, run `ng e2e`. Before using this command, you need to add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
